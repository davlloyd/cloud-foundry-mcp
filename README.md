# Cloud Foundry MCP Server

This MCP Server provides an LLM interface for interacting with your Cloud Foundry foundation. It was built with the [Spring AI MCP Server Boot Starter](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/mcp/mcp-server-boot-starter-docs.html).

### IMPORTANT
This MCP Server now uses the Streamable HTTP Transport, instead of SSE. If you are connecting to this server with Tanzu Platform Chat, be sure to consult the [README](https://github.com/cpage-pivotal/cf-mcp-client) for instructions on configuring the service binding for Streamable transport.

## Authentication Modes

The server supports two mutually exclusive authentication modes, determined automatically at startup:

| Mode | When it activates | MCP endpoint security | CF API calls run as |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Static Credentials** | `CF_USERNAME` and `CF_PASSWORD` are set, no OAuth2 `issuer-uri` | Open (no auth required) | The configured service account |
| **OAuth 2.1 (SSO)** | `spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri` is set (auto-configured on CF via the SSO tile) | JWT bearer token required | The authenticated user (token relay) |

### Static Credentials Mode

When `CF_USERNAME` and `CF_PASSWORD` environment variables are provided and no OAuth2 issuer is configured, the server disables HTTP security and uses the static credentials for all CF API calls. This is the simplest setup for local development and STDIO transport with tools like Claude Desktop.

### OAuth 2.1 Mode

When deployed to Cloud Foundry with a Tanzu SSO tile binding, the `java-cfenv-boot-pivotal-sso` library auto-configures the JWT issuer-uri, activating OAuth2 resource server security. Every request to `/mcp` must include a valid bearer token. The server relays the user's token to the CF API so that operations execute under the user's own permissions and role-based access control. See [FLOW.md](FLOW.md) for the full OAuth authorization flow.

## Building the Server

```bash
./mvnw clean package
```

## Running Locally with Static Credentials

Set the CF environment variables and run the jar directly. No OAuth infrastructure is needed.

```bash
export CF_APIHOST=api.sys.mycf.com
export CF_USERNAME=your-cf-username
export CF_PASSWORD=your-cf-password
export CF_ORG=your-org
export CF_SPACE=your-space

java -Dspring.ai.mcp.server.transport=stdio -jar target/cloud-foundry-mcp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=8040
```

Or configure it in Claude Desktop's `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cloud-foundry": {
      "command": "java",
      "args": [
        "-Dspring.ai.mcp.server.transport=stdio",
        "-Dlogging.file.name=cloud-foundry-mcp.log",
        "-jar",
        "/path/to/cloud-foundry-mcp/target/cloud-foundry-mcp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar",
        "--server.port=8040"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CF_APIHOST": "api.sys.mycf.com",
        "CF_USERNAME": "your-cf-username",
        "CF_PASSWORD": "your-cf-password",
        "CF_ORG": "your-org",
        "CF_SPACE": "your-space"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Deploying to Cloud Foundry

### With OAuth 2.1 (SSO Tile)

The recommended deployment model. Bind the app to a `p-identity` (SSO) service instance and provide only `CF_APIHOST`. No static credentials are needed — each user authenticates via the SSO tile and operations execute under their own identity.

```bash
cf push
```

The `manifest.yml` is pre-configured with an `sso` service binding and the `CF_APIHOST` variable.

### With Static Credentials (Variables File)

For environments without an SSO tile, use a variables file to inject static credentials. This approach keeps sensitive values out of your manifest and version control.

Create a file named `vars.yaml`:

```yaml
CF_APIHOST: api.sys.mycf.com
CF_USERNAME: your-cf-username
CF_PASSWORD: your-cf-password
CF_ORG: your-org
CF_SPACE: your-space
```

> **IMPORTANT:** The `vars.yaml` file contains sensitive credentials and should **never** be committed to Git. Add it to your `.gitignore` file:
> ```bash
> echo "vars.yaml" >> .gitignore
> ```

Uncomment the static credential variables in `manifest.yml`, then deploy:

```bash
cf push --vars-file=vars.yaml
```

The `manifest.yml` references these variables using the `((variable-name))` syntax, which injects them as environment variables at deploy time.

### Publishing to Tanzu Service Marketplace

You can publish this MCP server as a service in the Tanzu Platform marketplace using [Tanzu Service Publisher](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/platform/service-publisher/10-3/srvc-pub/app-publishing.html). This allows other applications to bind to the MCP server and consume it as a service.

#### Prerequisites

Before publishing, ensure:
- You have space developer privileges in the app's space
- The MCP server application is running
- A route is mapped to the app on the `apps.internal` domain using HTTP protocol

#### Service Definition

A `service.yaml` file is included in the root of this repository with the service configuration for publishing.

#### Publish the Service

Use the Tanzu cf CLI to publish the app:

```bash
cf publish-service cloud-foundry-mcp-server -f service.yaml
```

Check the publishing status:

```bash
cf published-service cloud-foundry-mcp-server
```

Wait until the status shows `successful`.

#### Enable Service Access

By default, new service offerings are disabled. An admin must enable access for the service to appear in the marketplace:

```bash
cf enable-service-access cloud-foundry-mcp
```

#### Create Service Instances

Once enabled, developers can create service instances:

```bash
cf create-service cloud-foundry-mcp default my-mcp-service
```

And bind them to applications:

```bash
cf bind-service my-app my-mcp-service
```
